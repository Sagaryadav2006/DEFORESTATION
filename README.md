Deforestation Prediction Project

1. Project Overview
This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict and monitor deforestation in vital tropical rainforests. By analyzing a rich dataset of satellite imagery and environmental factors, the model seeks to identify areas at high risk of future forest loss. The ultimate goal is to create a proactive tool that can help conservation organizations and policymakers make informed decisions to protect these critical ecosystems.

2. The Problem of Deforestation
Deforestation is a critical environmental issue with far-reaching consequences, including biodiversity loss, disruption of water cycles, soil erosion, and a significant contribution to global climate change. Traditional methods of monitoring are often reactive. This project takes a proactive approach, aiming to forecast deforestation events before they occur.

3. Objective
The primary objective is to build a robust predictive model that accurately classifies areas as being at high or low risk of a deforestation event. This involves:

Preprocessing and cleaning diverse geospatial and environmental data.

Analyzing the key drivers and indicators of deforestation.

Training and evaluating various machine learning models to find the most effective one.

Creating a system that can provide a "Predicted Risk Score" for a given geographical tile.

4. The Dataset
The analysis is based on the deforestation_sample_1100.csv dataset. This dataset contains 1100 unique observations, each representing a specific geographical tile at a particular point in time.

The data is split into train, validation, and test sets.

Key Data Features Include:
Geospatial Data: Latitude, Longitude, Elevation (m), Slope (°)

Climatic Data: Rainfall (mm), Temperature (°C), Cloud Cover (%)

Satellite Indices: NDVI (Vegetation Health), NDMI (Moisture Index), EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index)

Forest Metrics: Tree Cover (%), Canopy Height (m), Forest Loss Last 3Y (%)

Human Activity Indicators: Distance to Road (km), Distance to Settlement (km), Population Density, Fire Alerts (7d)

Land Use Data: Protected Area, Logging Concession

Target Variable: Deforestation Event (Yes=1, No=0)

5. Project Workflow
Data Loading: The initial dataset is loaded using Python's pandas library.

Data Preprocessing:

Column Name Cleaning: Standardized column names by removing special characters and spaces (e.g., Tree Cover (%) becomes tree_cover_percent).

Type Conversion: The Date column was converted to a datetime object for time-series analysis.

Categorical Encoding: Features like Region and Country were one-hot encoded to be used in the machine learning model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis to understand the relationships between different features and their correlation with deforestation events.

Model Building & Training: Different classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) will be trained on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: The models will be evaluated based on metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to determine the best-performing algorithm.
